# full-volume-MRI

This repository provides **sample full volume magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets** of **displacements** and **Lagrangian strains** for **intact and torn ovine rotator cuff tendons**, viewable in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).

## üìÅ Folder Structure

The repository includes two folders:
- `20231012/`
- `20231107/`

Each folder corresponds to the **timestamp of the experiment** and contains both **displacement** and **strain** datasets.

## üìà Displacement Data

Displacement fields are available for both **intact** and **torn** meshes.

- File prefixes indicate the **phase unwrapping method** used:
  - `Jon`: Code developed by Professor Jon Estrada
  - `sunwrap`: MATLAB function available publicly

## üí† Strain Data

Strain datasets are provided for the **torn mesh**, including:
- `LagrangeNormal`: Normal strain components of the Lagrangian strain tensor (E‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ, E‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ, E‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ)
- `LagrangeShear`: Shear strain components of the Lagrangian strain tensor (E‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ, E‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ, E‚ÇÇ‚ÇÉ)
- `maxShear`: Maximum shear strain

## üß© File Naming Convention for Strain Files

Strain filenames follow the format:

TIMESTAMPStrainType_XY.xdmf

Where:
- `X` = Type of strain component (normal or shear)
  - `1` = 1 mm
  - `2` = 2 mm
- `Y` = Condition  
  - `1` = Intact
  - `2` = Torn

The first index represents the amount of experimental elongation. The second index represent the condition of the tendon.

### Example:
- `20231107LagrangeNormal_12.xdmf` contains **normal strain** components for a **1 mm stretch in the torn condition**.
